He’s a loner. Parton’s husband likes a life of solitude – even though his wife commands the world stage. “My husband is a loner,” she told PEOPLE. “He doesn’t particularly care about being around anybody but me. He’s just always asked me to leave him out of all this. He does not like all the hullabaloo.” But that doesn’t mean Dean’s not supportive of his wife’s so-called “hullabaloo.” She told Parade that Dean’s “very secure within himself,” and never gets jealous of Parton’s stardom – and rotating cast of handsome co-stars. “This is his statement: ‘Well, hell, I know it’s not easy out there. I’d feel less about any man that didn’t fall in love with you,’ ” she shared.</p><p>5. He’s only seen Dolly perform a few times. Don’t expect to see Dean front row at Parton’s shows – as of 2011, he’d only seen her perform a few times. “No, he doesn’t like to do that,” Dolly told Ellen DeGeneres. “He gets nervous seeing me perform. It’s almost like seeing your kid in a recital. He’s afraid I’ll mess up. Actually, he has seen me a time or two and it did relax him a little. He saw that I do mess up and it’s OK because people are not gonna punish me for it.”</p><p>I want to know how Ellen reacted to the explanations , lol</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 27</td><td class=timestamp><span>November 4, 2021 11:00 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>[post redacted because linking to dailymail.co.uk clearly indicates that the poster is either a troll or an idiot (probably both, honestly.)
