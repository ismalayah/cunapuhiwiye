I said I wanted to do it again. He said, ‘What are you trying to do, make Eastman Kodak rich?’ He let me do it again. That time he said, ‘You did it all with your eyes closed. Now try it with your eyes open.’ The third take was like being shot out of a cannon. After it was over, it was all a blur. You have to trust the director.”</p><p>Tracy Letts said the inspiration for the play came to him in Oklahoma, his home state. “The Oklahoma City bombing hit me hard,” he said. “I was shocked that it was done by Americans. How far out of the matrix could you slip? The more I investigated paranoia, the more I saw how the connections feed on themselves and build out of control. What happens in this movie is that Agnes is leaping to catch up with Peter.”</p><p>The film is lean, direct, unrelenting. A lot of it takes place in the motel room, which by the end has been turned into an eerie cave, a sort of psychic air raid shelter against government emissions or who knows what else? “They’re watching us,” Peter says. Friedkin is often called a master of horror, but for him most modern horror films are really just violent comedies.</p><p>“For me, ‘United 93’ is a horror film,” he said. “It puts you in a place where you don’t want to go. The horror films that appeal to me are sort of reality: ‘<a href=#>Psycho</a>,' ‘<a href=#>Diabolique</a>,’ ‘Rosemary’s Baby.’ That Austrian director, <a href=#>Michael Haneke</a>, he’s the real deal. His ‘<a href=#>Funny Games</a>’ is the scariest film I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>“Me, too,” said Tracy Letts.</p><p>The thing about “Bug” is that we’re not scared for ourselves so much as for the characters in the movie. “At various times as I was reworking this play on the road,” Letts said, “the conclusion involved various paranoid linkings of every conspiracy in history, from John Wilkes Booth to Lee Harvey Oswald to aliens kidnapping people for experiments. With a certain kind of paranoia, it all connects.”</p><p>“I think that scaring people is what made me want to become a movie director,” Friedkin said. “When I was six or seven, I was sitting on our front porch in Chicago telling two girls that a murderer was killing people on our block, and our houses were next on his list. They were spellbound. When I saw I could get to them, I just kept going.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmn52jqba3rcusZpyZnqOytHmTZpmun12Xxm6y0aKcnaOZow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeopardy-mayim-bialik-giorgione-ruling-winner-tonight.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeopardy! fans accuse host Mayim Bialik of penalizing contestant despite 'reasonable' response in co</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./letitia-james-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-105888-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Letitia James Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boyz-n-the-hood-lyrics.html>Boyz N The Hood Lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-pownall.html>English Musician Alan Pownall Is Married To Actress, Gabriella Wilde</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matt-casale.html>Matt Casale, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Mika Boorem movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sv-leaks-and-or-rumours-thread-291881.html>SV Leaks and/or Rumours Thread | Page 12</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
