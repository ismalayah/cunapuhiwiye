None of the mysteries are explained at the end. Nor is any attempt made to fit together the two incompatible styles in the movie: (1) the scenes where Weathers turns into a speeded-up Superman who can run 40 miles an hour and jump out of tall buildings, and (2) the slice-of-life realism of welfare hotels and police headquarters.</p><p>“Action Jackson” feels like two different movies that ran into each other by accident. That could be funny, but this time it’s sick, because the movie’s comic scenes don’t go well with its particularly nasty streak of violence. Did we really need the scene where they pulled out the Mason jar containing the guy’s private parts or the various moments when people are burned alive? (I know, I know, guys are always being burned alive in the movies, and those are really only stunt men in asbestos underwear. But in a comedy?) The movie has another problem: Weathers. He was well-cast as Apollo Creed, who had essentially one note to play, and played it. But in this more ambitious role he doesn’t have the necessary charisma; he looks great, but lacks presence, especially against scene-stealers such as Nelson, <a href=#>Roger Aaron Brown</a> and (especially) Vanity. And that leads me to the movie’s one redeeming merit, which is Vanity’s performance.</p><p>Again this time, as in “<a href=#>52 Pick-Up</a>,” she shows a natural screen presence, a grace and easiness under pressure. I had the feeling, watching Vanity in this unhappy movie, that she could play anyone in any movie and make it work. She has a couple of nice song numbers, too, although they’re spoiled by overemphasis on the electronic rhythms.</p><p>“Action Jackson” looks like it was intended as the first in a possible series of movies starring the same character. If they’re going to make another one, I suggest they decide if it’s supposed to be a violent movie, or a comedy. It might also pick things up if they put Vanity in the lead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46amq2hn6N6q63CpKqopl1mhnmE</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-what-the-cast-of-a-live-action-tangled-could-look-like.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Heres What The Cast Of A Live-Action Tangled Could Look Like</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stony-wilderness.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stony Wilderness - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boyz-n-the-hood-lyrics.html>Boyz N The Hood Lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-pownall.html>English Musician Alan Pownall Is Married To Actress, Gabriella Wilde</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matt-casale.html>Matt Casale, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Mika Boorem movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sv-leaks-and-or-rumours-thread-291881.html>SV Leaks and/or Rumours Thread | Page 12</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
