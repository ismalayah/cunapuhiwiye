Not that the wheelman initially makes life easy for himself. Driving the wet nighttime streets, he looks terribly confident and competent, and when he picks up the two bank robbers, he very aggressively high-hats them, refusing to give them a name and snootily telling them that he’s not here for small talk. No, he’s here to be a good dad, as his cell-phone conversations with his rebellious teenage daughter Katie tell us. I don’t trust crime movies in which the lead character has some sort of fixation with being Father of the Year, but that turns out to be hardly the biggest problem here.</p><p>No, the biggest problem is the aforementioned formal constraint that writer-director Rush sets up. Deriving inspiration (I presume) from the 2013 Tom-Hardy-starring drama “<a href=#>Locke</a>,” this is a getaway car chase movie that aspires to remain entirely within the car. (Actually, within two cars, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.) After the first snafu, in which Grillo’s wheelman leaves behind the robbers (this may be a silly question but given the fact that this movie is entirely night-set, I had to wonder why the bank they knocked over was open so late), he is obliged to play cat and mouse with a variety of unknown-number phone callers, all of whom are abusive and make terrible demands of him. They also all sound as if they’ve been doing “<a href=#>Goodfellas</a>” karaoke.</p><p>For what seems like hours, these various characters exchange “Who are you”s, “where are you”s, “where’s my money”s, “f**k you”s, “f**k you motherf**er”s, and so on. Mr. Rush doesn’t seem to grasp that one reason “Locke “worked was that even though it stuck with one man in one car talking to a variety of people, those people were articulately voiced. More than that, they were brilliantly acted; one of the characters was played by <a href=#>Olivia Colman</a>. And the movie’s writer/director Edward Knight had crafted a multi-leveled, suspenseful storyline to be talked through.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46wn56dnKKur3mRaWhw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./karick-hotel-elmina-ghana.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Karick Hotel, Elmina, Ghana</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-scarborough.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joe Scarborough Age, Net worth: Wife, Weight, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boyz-n-the-hood-lyrics.html>Boyz N The Hood Lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-pownall.html>English Musician Alan Pownall Is Married To Actress, Gabriella Wilde</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matt-casale.html>Matt Casale, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Mika Boorem movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sv-leaks-and-or-rumours-thread-291881.html>SV Leaks and/or Rumours Thread | Page 12</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
