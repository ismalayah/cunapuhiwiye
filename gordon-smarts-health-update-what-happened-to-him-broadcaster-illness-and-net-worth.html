Smart started his career as a journalist at DC Thomson in Dundee in June 1998, where he worked as a junior reporter for the Evening Telegraph and the Dundee Courier.</p><p>He studied journalism at Edinburgh’s Napier University. After being unable to find work in journalism, Smart taught football for the Dutch company Coerver between 2001 and 2002. Following two football injuries, he returned to Scotland to work for Deadline Press and Picture Agency, covering news in the east of Scotland.&nbsp;When the MTV Europe Music Awards were held in Edinburgh in 2003, Smart was introduced to Victoria Newton, then-editor of The Sun newspaper’s Bizarre entertainment column. Victoria Newton assigned him shifts at the Sun in London, which led to a three-month contract with the News of the World.</p><p>Smart started working as Victoria Newton’s assistant for Bizarre at The Sun in 2004. He was one of the witnesses of the 2013 Glasgow “Clutha” Pub helicopter crash, which killed 10 people. Smart joined the Sun in London as a deputy editor in May 2016 but left unexpectedly in November to pursue other business and broadcasting interests.</p><h2>What Happened To Gordon Smart’s Illness And Health Update?</h2><p>Fans are curious about <strong>Gordon Smart’s illness</strong> after speculations of his illness circulated a while ago. However, we know that Gordon Smart is OK at the time of writing this post since Gordon has not divulged anything about his illness to his supporters.&nbsp;To demonstrate this, he tweeted good morning and thanked Charlotte Hawkins for hosting him on her program. As a result, we can state that Gordon Smart is well and healthy right now, and the stories of Gordon Smart Illness are all untrue.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gordon-Smart-1.jpg alt="Gordon Smart" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Nonetheless, on December 29, he was chastised for his remark regarding former EastEnders actor Joe, which he intended as a jest. “Brilliant news, how exciting for them,” Charlotte said. “They’re going to have a busy House, aren’t they?” they wondered as they pondered the family’s latest news.&nbsp;Gordon, a 42-year-old former entertainment editor, joked about having Joe’s “number for a decent surgeon” before the former EastEnders actor became a father for the fourth time.&nbsp;Charlotte, 47, was taken dumbfounded when he remarked, “Time for him to hang up his boots.”&nbsp;Scarlette apologized between laughter before adding, “From all of us here at GMB, we extend them both our very best wishes; congratulations!” She spoke up.</p><h2>Gordon Smart’s Net worth</h2><p>Gordon seems to be a bit guarded about his personal details, such as his net worth, since the broadcaster has not divulged anything about it.&nbsp;However, according to several estimates, <strong>Gordon’s net worth</strong> as of 2023 is more than $3 million. Gordon, on the other hand, has yet to corroborate this information.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gordon-Smart-2.jpg alt="Gordon Smart" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>His principal income comes from his work as a journalist. Despite his wealth, the presenter does not seem to love spending his money on items like supercars, fancy outfits, designer watches, and so on, since he has not uploaded any photographs of himself flexing them.&nbsp;He does, however, seem to like taking trips, as he routinely tweets images of himself traveling to different locations with his family and friends.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGieqKqUpLtuv8yaqa2rXZ2yorjToWSuqJSWwaZ51qGYrWWYlr2xsc2em2asn2K1qrmMm6momZSYrrTAxKtkoqSco7K0v4yapZ1lnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./regina-schneider.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Regina Schneider movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christopher-oneill-bio-wiki-age-height-princess-madeleine-and-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christopher ONeill Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Princess Madeleine and Net Worth.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boyz-n-the-hood-lyrics.html>Boyz N The Hood Lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-pownall.html>English Musician Alan Pownall Is Married To Actress, Gabriella Wilde</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matt-casale.html>Matt Casale, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Mika Boorem movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sv-leaks-and-or-rumours-thread-291881.html>SV Leaks and/or Rumours Thread | Page 12</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
