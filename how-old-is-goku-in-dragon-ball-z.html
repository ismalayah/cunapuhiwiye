Upon his arrival, Goku is found by Bulma, a teenage girl who is in search of the Dragon Balls.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>Over the series and its successors, Dragon Ball Z, GT, and Super, Goku becomes one of the most skilled fighters in the universe and uses his Saiyan powers to take down any of the dangerous foes who may threaten the Earth, and later the universe.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>One thing that isn’t expanded on? Goku’s age. We know that when he was initially found by Bulma he was 11 years old, but with the time skips and occasional time-traveling escapades in the series, it’s hard to keep up with with what Goku’s current age is.</p><h3 id=h-how-old-is-goku-in-dragon-ball data-injectable=false>How old is Goku in Dragon Ball?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dragon-ball.png><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>When we first meet Goku in Dragon Ball, he is 11 years old. Throughout the series, we see Goku turn 12 and compete in the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament before a three-year gap until the 22nd edition of the tournament. Having the metric of these tournaments being spaced three years apart, it would be reasonable to assume, after training with Kami and Mister Popo, when Goku competes in the 23rd tournament defeating Piccolo and marrying Chi Chi he is 18 years old.</p><h3 id=h-how-old-is-goku-in-dragon-ball-z data-injectable=false>How old is Goku in Dragon Ball Z?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Goku-Dragonball-Z.png><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>Picking up some years after the events of Dragon Ball, in Dragon Ball Z Goku’s son, Gohan is five years old. During the Saiyan Saga, in which Goku sacrifices his life so Picollo can take out his brother Raditz, he dies a 23-year-old man. This is where the timeline can get confusing. When he is resurrected a year later, he is brought back and would be chronologically 24, but his body remains the same as when he died at 23.</p><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>After the conclusion of the following major arc, the Frieza Saga, Goku spends three years training with Vegeta, Gohan, and fellow Z fighters before the arrival of the Androids. In preparation for the Cell games, Gohan and Goku enter the Hyperbolic Time Chamber where time functions differently. To them, they are inside training for a year and so their bodies emerge one year older, however, chronologically a year has yet to pass meaning that Goku’s age syncs right back up to 27 years old.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>After Goku sacrifices himself in the fight against Cell, he remains dead for seven years until being revived once again by Elder Kai to take on the Earth’s latest threat, Majin Buu. Chronologically, this would put Goku at 34 years old, however, his body still remains 27 just as when he initially died.</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>After defeating Buu, Dragon Ball Z has a 10-year time jump for its epilogue. Goku’s chronological age at the end of Dragon Ball Z is 44, however, his body is 37.</p><h3 id=h-how-old-is-goku-in-dragon-ball-super data-injectable=false>How old is Goku in Dragon Ball Super?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ultra-Instinct-Goku-edited.jpg><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>Dragon Ball Super takes place in the 10-year gap between the defeat of Majin Buu and the closing epilogue of the series. When the show picks up it is believed to be around four years into the timeline placing Goku at around 38 years old chronologically but within his 31-year-old body.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>The series and sequel movie Dragon Ball Super: Broly has only taken place over about a year so far meaning that to this point Goku’s chronological age is 39 yet his physical age is 32.</p><h3 id=h-how-old-is-goku-in-dragon-ball-gt data-injectable=false>How old is Goku in Dragon Ball GT?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Super-Saiyan-4-Goku.jpg><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>While it isn’t technically canon, Dragon Ball GT was released prior to Super and exists on its own timeline, taking place five years after the epilogue of Dragon Ball Z. At the beginning of the series Goku, is chronologically 49 years old within the body of his 42-year-old self. But he’s quickly reverted into his 11-year-old body due to the accidental use of the Dragon Balls by Emperor Pilaf.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>For the remainder of the series, Goku remains in this body closing out the show as a 51-one-year-old man in a 13-year-old body. Fortunately, he does get his original form back in the series epilogue after merging with the Eternal Dragon. But this takes place a century into the future, so while Goku may look to be back in his physical prime, he is technically a 151-year-old man.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpqWcXZ7AbrPOpKxmoZ5isbOtxqilZpqRobluxo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-little-mermaid-hasnt-even-released-and-disney-diehards-have-already-decided-on-the-worst-part-of-the-movie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Little Mermaid hasnt even released and Disney diehards have already decided on the wors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./29642568-dolly-parton-shares-rare-photo-of-her-husband-carl-thomas-dean.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dolly Parton shares rare photo of her husband Carl Thomas Dean</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boyz-n-the-hood-lyrics.html>Boyz N The Hood Lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-pownall.html>English Musician Alan Pownall Is Married To Actress, Gabriella Wilde</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matt-casale.html>Matt Casale, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Mika Boorem movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sv-leaks-and-or-rumours-thread-291881.html>SV Leaks and/or Rumours Thread | Page 12</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
