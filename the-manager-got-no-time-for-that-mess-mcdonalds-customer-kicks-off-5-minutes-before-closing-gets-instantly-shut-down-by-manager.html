The same can be said for this notable leader at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>McDonald’s</strong></a>, who was able to shut down this customer after he arrived at a drive-thru five minutes before closing, thinking that there would still be food waiting for him upon his arrival.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>The customer in question pulled out his camera and started recording after being informed that there was no food left at his local McDonald’s. The guy believed the stoves would still be on this late because “they’re not closed yet,” which is technically true. However, his attitude immediately changed when the manager intervened and reiterated what his employees told him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true><a title=@jessicabaileyhassan href=#>@jessicabaileyhassan</a><p>Mcdonalds Customer Betates Employees At 5 Minutes Till Closing</p><a title="♬ original sound - JessicaBaileyHassan" href=#>♬ original sound – JessicaBaileyHassan</a></figure><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>It’s no surprise that this individual quickly changed his tune when speaking to a manager, hoping to be on good terms and receive some food. Fortunately, the manager saw through his facade and defended the two young women who were simply doing their jobs. It would be no surprise if the manager overheard what transpired before stepping in.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>This just shows that some people stumble when faced with authority. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SimplyPsychology</a>, individuals often become obedient in the presence of someone with higher power. This isn’t the first time we have witnessed something like this on TikTok; as we recently saw&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a Karen who shifted her tone when she also faced a manager at a drive-thru.</a></p><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">St. Louis Magazine</a>&nbsp;points out that the interpretation of closing times varies between restaurants and retail shops due to how they operate. Kitchens tend to close earlier, allowing employees to begin cleanup. Consequently, when someone arrives 5 to 10 minutes before closing, it becomes uncertain whether or not they can be served. However, the same can be said for customers since some individuals, like this drive-thru customer, thinks it’s acceptable to order food this late purely on the basis of business hours.</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>“The customer is always right” has always been a saying in the service industry, and strictly speaking, this customer was technically correct since he arrived before it closed. However, thanks to social media, we now witness managers no longer abiding by that statement when necessary. So if a restaurant says they’re closed because you arrive very late, just listen to them; arguing won’t create a better outcome.</p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=78 data-injectable=false>Maybe he should have arrived a bit earlier if he wanted his Big Macs so badly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8tbTEZqSappGcsrN5xqirZqafYsGqucRmnaiqXam1osCMppysq12isKW7zZqjnatdmMK0wM6mnKtlm56wrL%2BMqJ2fZWViuqq61K2crGWSmrOwvsRmmqWno567qHnGnqusZZmjwLWtza2jsmWjncK1ecOorqdlkq56rq3Nmp6eql8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-studio-animated-my-adventures-with-superman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What studio animated My Adventures with Superman?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./quintessa-swindell.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Netflix's Trinkets Actress, Quintessa Swindell Is Dating A Mysterious Guy (Bio, Age, Boyfriend, TV S</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boyz-n-the-hood-lyrics.html>Boyz N The Hood Lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-pownall.html>English Musician Alan Pownall Is Married To Actress, Gabriella Wilde</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matt-casale.html>Matt Casale, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Mika Boorem movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sv-leaks-and-or-rumours-thread-291881.html>SV Leaks and/or Rumours Thread | Page 12</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
