No officers were injured in the shootout, according to a CNN report.</p><p>Speaking to 14 News, Evansville Police Sergeant Anna Gray gave more details about what happened. "Officers were on scene very quickly, went right into Walmart. We were given a description of the suspect. Officers then began to look for the suspect."</p><p>She added that the suspect would fire at officers before running away while in the store.</p><p>Vanderburgh County Sheriff Noah Robinson, whose officers also responded to the shooting, noted a change in police tactics when dealing with shooters since the 1999 Columbine High School shooting.</p><p>"Immediately, we assembled a team with the Evansville Police Department, and began to look for the threat," 14 News quoted him as saying.</p><p>"You may recall that decades ago, the Columbine model, that came across—when you secure a scene and wait for reinforcements to contain a situation.</p><p>"That's no longer a model we practice. If there's active gunfire, we immediately go to the threat and neutralize that threat, to minimize the loss of life," he added.</p><p>In a statement obtained by 14 News, Walmart said: "The entire Walmart family is shocked by the senseless violence that occurred at our Evansville store, and our hearts are with our associate at this time.
