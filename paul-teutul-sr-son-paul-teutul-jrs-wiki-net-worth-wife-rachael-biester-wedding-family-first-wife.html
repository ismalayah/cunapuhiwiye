He later established his own business called Paul Jr. Designs, which manufactures custom motorcycles; the shop also sells branded clothing.</p><h2><span id=The_Net_Worth_of_Paul_Teutul_Jr>The Net Worth of Paul Teutul Jr</span></h2><p>How rich is Paul Teutul Jr? As of late-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is over $10 million, mostly earned through a successful career in business, but elevated significantly thanks to his exposure on television. As he continues his career, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h2><span id=American_Chopper>American Chopper</span></h2>Little is known about Paul’s life before his television appearances, but his <a rel=nofollow href=#>popularity</a> started to increase as he featured in “American Chopper” in 2003. The show focuses on him along with his father who manages the company Orange County Choppers, based in Newburgh, New York. They manufacture custom chopper-style motorcycles, on which the series featured. However, the contrasting creative styles and methods of the father-son duo often lead them to verbal argument, and became a trademark of the show until 2008, when an argument between the two got too far. While the <a rel=nofollow href=#>show</a> originally aired on the Discovery Channel, it was later moved to their sister channel TLC for the sixth season in 2009. However, the following year the show was cancelled, and with the reconciliation of the two, they created a new series entitled “American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior”. The show made its way back to the Discovery Channel before ending its run in 2012 with “The Chopper Live: The Revenge”, completing a total of 10 seasons.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Genie_Chopper_with_Custom_Builder_Paul_Teutul_Jr.jpg><h2><span id=Lawsuits>Lawsuits</span></h2><p>Prior to the start of “American Chopper”, Teutul Jr and his brother Daniel were named in a lawsuit brought on behalf of Turner Construction, which alleged fraudulent transfer. The problems stemmed to years back when they were a part of OC Ironworks Company. According to reports, assets were stripped for OC Ironworks, and they transferred all viable assets, personnel and contracts to a new company called OC Ironworks LLC. They then bankrupted the former, and the assets were sold to the new company with unfair compensation. Trustees wanted to rule the transfer as fraudulent so that they could be set until the new company becomes liable for the old company debts. A settlement was reached with Orange County LLC, paying $500,000 which was distributed to creditors.</p><p>Another issue that happened was after the explosive argument that Jr and Sr had during “American Chopper”, leading to Jr terminating his participation. He then established his own business called Paul Jr. Designs, with a civil action lawsuit still in place. The two later reconciled and he returned to the old company, but eventually decided to terminate his employment as a full time member of the staff, opting to become a consultant. The lawsuit was also settled out of court, with Sr purchasing his 20% share in the company.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Father, son reunite restoring Yanks motorcycle <a rel=nofollow href=#>https://t.co/RqDFMAIcMF</a> via <a rel=nofollow href=#>@MLB</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>@feinsand</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/bdqAdJWSTX</a></p><p>— Paul Jr (@WhereIsPaulJr) <a rel=nofollow href=#>July 13, 2018</a></p><h2><span id=Paul_Jr_Designs>Paul Jr Designs</span></h2><p>Prior to creating his own company, Paul started leading his own designs with OCC, and also designed a dog park located in Montgomery, New York. A report was then released by TMZ stating his intentions to start his <a rel=nofollow href=#>own motorcycle business</a>, and was recruiting former employees of his father’s company such as Vinnie DiMartino and Michael Teutul. However, they had to wait for one year due to a non-compete clause with Orange County Choppers that he signed before leaving the company. Paul Jr. Designs were later featured in “American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior”.</p><p>While the show has ended, the two companies still serve as direct competition with each other, and more former OCC employees have now joined Paul. In 2014, it was reported that he created two bikes for Blizzard Entertainment for their video game “World of Warcraft”, and also created bikes for the film “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows”.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>For his personal life, it is known that Teutul Jr married Rachael Biester in 2010, and they have a son who was born five years later. The couple were featured in the TLC show entitled “Say Yes to the Dress”, in which Rachael was shown choosing her wedding dress. Paul is the eldest of four children, with younger brothers Daniel who is the owner of Orange County Ironworks LLC, and Michael who has been featured in “American Chopper”. The youngest is sister Cristin who works as a nurse, based in Rochester, New York State.</p><p>Similar to numerous television personalities and businessmen, he is highly active online through social media accounts, on Instagram and Twitter on which he promotes some of the work he’s done as a part of Paul Jr. Designs, while also showcasing a few of his latest projects. He also features apparel that is sold through his business, and appears in numerous public events. His business has its own Facebook page which promotes his latest book, entitled “The Build” which was released in 2017, and provides readers with insights behind the scenes of “American Chopper”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlpuuqr7PqKqtZpOkunC8wK6jZqyVqsG2uIysqWarn6N6sa3UpWStnaWpwq15yauqZq%2BZoLZuusStZLCnoqm1bsPIn5xmqpGYtaKxy2aZop2jqbKzedaem52hnpx6p63MoqOyZZaev7TAjLCgn51f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shiv-nadars-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-life-story.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shiv Nadars biography, fact, career, awards, net worth &amp;amp; life story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blake-sims-age-wiki-biography-family-body-measurement-parents-salary-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blake Sims Age, Wiki, Biography, Family, Body Measurement, Parents, Salary, Net worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boyz-n-the-hood-lyrics.html>Boyz N The Hood Lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-pownall.html>English Musician Alan Pownall Is Married To Actress, Gabriella Wilde</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matt-casale.html>Matt Casale, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Mika Boorem movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sv-leaks-and-or-rumours-thread-291881.html>SV Leaks and/or Rumours Thread | Page 12</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
