In Perth, Australia, the approaching firestorm is set to arrive in about 12&nbsp;</span><span>hours and the mood of the remaining populace veers between grim resignation (with&nbsp;</span><span>suicides aplenty) and a determination to make Earth's remaining moments play out&nbsp;</span><span>like a mash-up of "The Road Warrior" and "<a href=#>The Purge</a>." Our anti-hero, James (Nathan&nbsp;</span><span>Phillips), is leaning more towards the latter and after a farewell snog with girlfriend Zoe&nbsp;</span><span>(Jessica de Gouw), he decides to leave her alone so that he can spend the rest of&nbsp;</span><span>his time at a wild bacchanal thrown by friend Freddy (<a href=#>Daniel Henshall</a>) with his other&nbsp;</span><span>girlfriend, Vicky (<a href=#>Kathryn Beck</a>) and not even her revelations that she is pregnant can&nbsp;</span><span>convince him to stay. He wants to get messed up because, as he puts it, "I don't want to&nbsp;</span><span>feel a thing."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>James heads off to the party that he has placed above everything else, and&nbsp;</span><span>after getting waylaid along the way, he sees a little girl who has been abducted by a couple of&nbsp;</span><span>depraved weirdos for presumably unspeakable reasons. D</span><span>espite his insistence&nbsp;</span><span>that he no longer cares about anything, he rescues the girl, Rose (<a href=#>Angourie Rice</a>), and&nbsp;</span><span>when he is unable to reunite her with her father, he decides to take her along to the&nbsp;</span><span>party in the hopes of finding someone there who can take her to be reunited with her&nbsp;</span><span>family. Needless to say, as they go along their trek, the two bear witness to any number&nbsp;</span><span>of horrible sights but Rose's optimism and innocence in the face of the oncoming&nbsp;</span><span>apocalypse (Spoiler Alert!) begins to change his cynical soul. Once they arrive at the&nbsp;</span><span>party—an orgy of open sex, prodigious drug and alcohol abuse and bouts of Russian&nbsp;</span><span>Roulette—he discovers that nihilism may no longer be his thing and tries to get Rose&nbsp;</span><span>back together with her family and settle his own outstanding emotional debts before it is&nbsp;</span><span>really too late.</span></p><p>Written and directed by <a href=#>Zak Hilditch</a>, "These Final Hours" is more ambitious than its&nbsp;<span>presumably inexpensive origins might suggest but this is the kind of storyline that has&nbsp;</span><span>been done dozens of times before and even the better parts of this effort contain more&nbsp;</span><span>than a whiff of the familiar. The finale, for example, is presented in a relatively striking&nbsp;</span><span>manner but anyone who has seen the vastly superior apocalyptic drama "<a href=#>Take Shelter</a>"&nbsp;</span><span>will no doubt notice a number of similarities between the two climaxes. Likewise,&nbsp;</span><span>the relationship between Phillips (whose presence here, following on the heels of&nbsp;</span><span>appearances in such films as "<a href=#>Wolf Creek</a>," "Snake on a Plane" and "The Chernobyl&nbsp;</span><span>Diaries," marks him as one of the guys you least want to have with you on a cinematic&nbsp;</span><span>excursion of any duration) and Rice doesn't really hit any overtly wrong notes but&nbsp;</span><span>nevertheless fails to break any new ground either. Even the end-of-the-world blowout&nbsp;</span><span>is nowhere as decadent as one might hope—from what we see, it basically feels like&nbsp;</span><span>Burning Man sans the morning-after hangovers—and when it does threaten to become&nbsp;</span><span>transgressive, as when little Rose is dosed with Ecstasy and begins tripping, it pulls&nbsp;</span><span>back the reins before things can get too weird.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn56rlWKzqrrApWShp6WnwG5%2Bj2ps</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-the-r-rating-for-oppenheimer-is-a-good-thing.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why the R-rating for Oppenheimer is a good thing</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-dance-of-reality-2014.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Dance of Reality movie review (2014)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boyz-n-the-hood-lyrics.html>Boyz N The Hood Lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-pownall.html>English Musician Alan Pownall Is Married To Actress, Gabriella Wilde</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matt-casale.html>Matt Casale, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Mika Boorem movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sv-leaks-and-or-rumours-thread-291881.html>SV Leaks and/or Rumours Thread | Page 12</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
