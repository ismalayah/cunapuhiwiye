Targeting troubled teens, Vecna initiates a murder tactic known as Vecna’s Curse — a term derived from the popular tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons — which inflicts headaches and nosebleeds, then progresses towards a development of psychosis that stems from reliving the victim’s most traumatic experience. After wearing them down, he executes his target using psychokinesis to make them levitate and snap their skeletons.</p><p data-characters=716 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>After Vecna claimed his first victim, Chrissy Cunningham, it was Fred and Nancy who took it upon themselves to investigate where Chrissy was last seen alive. Upon arrival, Fred and Nancy are stopped by Hawkins Police, at which point Vecna begins manipulating Fred’s mind; he hallucinates that the officer’s face becomes grotesque and disfigured, all while he aggressively chants that Fred is a murderer. When Nancy departs to interrogate Wayne Munson about Chrissy’s murder, Fred wanders off into the forest, where he envisions the wreckage of a car crash — which audiences assume him to be responsible for — and is taunted by undead mourners. While Fred panics, Vecna extracts his next victim.</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Although he appears only briefly, Fred Bunson — in the grand scheme of things — is an important plot device for Vecna’s conniving plot to subjugate Hawkins, although not every Stranger Things fan feels the same. Over on Reddit, one Fred Benson sympathizer attempts to rally support for the long-deceased character, but to no avail, as fellow Stranger Things fanatics argue incessantly about how crucial Fred’s character really was — and why he was so forgettable.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Why don’t more people talk about him? He had a pretty sudden death.</a> from <a href=#>StrangerThings</a></figure><p data-characters=634 data-current-count=934 data-injectable=true>Immediately, a convincing argument is made that Fred simply didn’t have enough screen time to be a worthwhile character. Stranger Things fans have argued that Grace Van Dien’s Chrissy Cunningham was more likeable, had more potential and made a long-lasting impression, which made her departure all the more distressing. Fred, on the other hand, barely evolved beyond the ‘survivor’s guilt’ trope that was mapped out for him from the beginning. One user, u/Tayto-Sandwich, notes that Fred had “very little to suck us in” as far as making his storyline engaging, and that description feels apt.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Ilikelamp7’s comment from discussion "Why don’t more people talk about him?

Sorry, Fred, but you’re on your own.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>MagmaMixer’s comment from discussion "Why don’t more people talk about him? He had a pretty sudden death."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>Although Fred is the quintessential ’80s nerd with a somewhat relatable lifestyle, he undermines Nancy Wheeler’s authority and ridicules her relationship with Jonathan Byers, making him present as needy, overbearing and personifying the “pick me” mindset. It’s so obvious that he wants to date Nancy, so that desperation becomes really annoying. Countless fans have simply called him “creepy” — and we have to agree.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>byharryconnolly’s comment from discussion "Why don’t more people talk about him?

We’re not saying that we don’t care about Fred’s death, but we’re not not saying that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9KtqZqml5q%2FbsDHoqWgq12brq9506ugnqtdlrulecWaoKWrXam8brDRrqRmraBiwLa8z6iprWWWpL9urYydnJqqnK56pbHPmqmtnZRisKmt0ZqarZ2iZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./walmart-shooting-horror-woman-gunnded-down-inside-indiana-store-evansville-1775185.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Walmart Shooting Horror as Woman Gunned Down Inside Indiana Store</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./trillian-wood-smith-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-422093-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Trillian Wood-Smith Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./boyz-n-the-hood-lyrics.html>Boyz N The Hood Lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-pownall.html>English Musician Alan Pownall Is Married To Actress, Gabriella Wilde</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./matt-casale.html>Matt Casale, Author at We Got This Covered</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Mika Boorem movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sv-leaks-and-or-rumours-thread-291881.html>SV Leaks and/or Rumours Thread | Page 12</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
